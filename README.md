# RichTextEditorUI

A modern and customizable UI component for rich text editing.

## ðŸš§ Under Development

**RichTextEditorUI** is currently in its **alpha stage**. At this phase, it primarily serves two purposes:

- Manual Testing: Used internally to test RichTextArea (the core product of RangeX).
- Demo Integration: Showcased on the homepage to demonstrate text editing capabilities.

While the project is functional, expect potential changes in APIs, features, and stability.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **`src/Production/`** â€“ Contains the main library code. Everything inside this folder is included in the build process.
- **`src/Development/`** â€“ A development/testing environment for experimenting with components.
- **`index.ts`** â€“ Entry point demonstrating basic usage of the library.
